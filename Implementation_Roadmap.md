## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Development Standards
- **Code Quality**: Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow
- **Testing**: Unit tests for critical functions, integration tests for APIs
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and API documentation
- **Security**: Input validation, authentication, and authorization

### 2. Performance Targets
- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms
- **Mobile Performance**: Lighthouse score > 90
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with proper indexing
- **Image Loading**: Lazy loading and optimization

### 3. Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh tokens
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **File Upload Security**: Type and size validation
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and CORS configuration

### 4. Responsive Design Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: 1024px and above
- **Approach**: Mobile-first responsive design

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **File Upload System**
   - Risk: Security vulnerabilities, large file handling
   - Mitigation: Strict validation, size limits, secure storage

2. **Database Performance**
   - Risk: Slow queries with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, query optimization, pagination

3. **Authentication Security**
   - Risk: Token vulnerabilities, session management
   - Mitigation: JWT best practices, token expiration, refresh tokens

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Cross-browser Compatibility**
   - Risk: Inconsistent behavior across browsers
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, polyfills, testing

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Risk: Poor mobile user experience
   - Mitigation: Mobile-first design, touch-friendly interfaces
